/**
 * What each offer replaces, and roughly what that alternative costs today.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — two different kinds of number are deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *   `alternative.cost` is what the conventional approach costs, and its
 *   provenance differs per entry. The lead-list figure is typical annual spend
 *   supplied by the business. The assistant and contractor ranges are still
 *   ILLUSTRATIVE ESTIMATES — plausible, but not sourced research and not
 *   claims about any named vendor. Same rule as `stack.ts`; check those two
 *   before they carry weight in a pitch.
 *
 *   `offer.cost` is NEVER invented. Only Jarvis CRM has a published price, so
 *   the other three say how they are quoted rather than what they cost. Do not
 *   put a number here that has not actually been set.
 *
 * No saving is stated as a total, because the honest comparison depends on
 * scope and neither side is a fixed number.
